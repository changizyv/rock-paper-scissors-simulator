# 🎮 The Epic Rock-Paper-Scissors War: Digital Edition! 🪨📄✂️

Welcome to the battleground where rocks, papers, and scissors are throwing shade and battling it out to be the undisputed champion of the ring!  
This project is a fun simulator that feels like you tossed the good ol' rock-paper-scissors into a blender and hit turbo mode! 😎  
Just make a guess, sit back, and watch the chaos unfold.  
Fair warning though: this game is addictive!

## 🚀 What’s in the game?

- **Automated Element Battle**: Rocks, papers, and scissors fly around the screen like caffeinated ants, converting each other on contact!
- **Guess and Chill**: Predict the winner before the battle begins. If you guess right, treat yourself to some ice cream. 🍦
- **Custom Quantity**: Choose how many of each element enters the arena. (Don’t go overboard though — your CPU has feelings!)
- **Live Chart**: A slick graph tracking which element is dominating the battle. Stocks? Nah — Scissors!
- **Cool Timer**: Displays time in stylish mm:ss format — like the Element Olympics!
- **Sounds & Effects**: Ding-ding sounds for hits, and a glorious fireworks show at the end.
- **Turbo Mode**: Hold down the fast-forward button to bend time and space! ⏩
- **Reset & Replay**: Because who plays just once? 😜

## ⚠️ Warning: May cause laughter and compulsive rematches!

This game is purely for fun.  
If you use it at parties to place bets — well, we don’t officially endorse it...  
but we support you emotionally — with tea and cookies. ☕🍪

And hey, if you win, toss a star our way. If you lose, toss two!  
We worked hard, okay? 🌟
